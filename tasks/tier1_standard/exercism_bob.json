  "prompt": "# Introduction\n\nBob is a [lackadaisical][] teenager.\nHe likes to think that he's very cool.\nAnd he definitely doesn't get excited about things.\nThat wouldn't be cool.\n\nWhen people talk to him, his responses are pretty limited.\n\n[lackadaisical]: https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lackadaisical\n# Instructions\n\nYour task is to determine what Bob will reply to someone when they say something to him or ask him a question.\n\nBob only ever answers one of five things:\n\n- **\"Sure.\"**\n  This is his response if you ask him a question, such as \"How are you?\"\n  The convention used for questions is that it ends with a question mark.\n- **\"Whoa, chill out!\"**\n  This is his answer if you YELL AT HIM.\n  The convention used for yelling is ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.\n- **\"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!\"**\n  This is what he says if you yell a question at him.\n- **\"Fine. Be that way!\"**\n  This is how he responds to silence.\n  The convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of whitespace characters.\n- **\"Whatever.\"**\n  This is what he answers to anything else.\n\nPlace the implementation in src/core/bob.py",
