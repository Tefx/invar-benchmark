Find the next unmarked number in your list (skipping over marked numbers).\n   This is a prime number.\n2. Mark all the multiples of that prime number as **not** prime.\n\nYou keep repeating these steps until you've gone through every number in your list.\nAt the end, all the unmarked numbers are prime.\n\n~~~~exercism/note\nThe tests don't check that you've implemented the algorithm, only that you've come up with the correct list of primes.\nTo check you are implementing the Sieve correctly, a good first test is to check that you do not use division or remainder operations.\n~~~~\n\n## Example\n\nLet's say you're finding the primes less than or equal to 10.\n\n- List out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, leaving them all unmarked.\n- 2 is unmarked and is therefore a prime.\n  Mark 4, 6, 8 and 10 as \"not prime\".\n- 3 is unmarked and is therefore a prime.\n  Mark 6 and 9 as not prime _(marking 6 is optional - as it's already been marked)_.\n- 4 is marked as \"not prime\", so we skip over it.\n- 5 is unmarked and is therefore a prime.\n  Mark 10 as not prime _(optional - as it's already been marked)_.\n- 6 is marked as \"not prime\", so we skip over it.\n- 7 is unmarked and is therefore a prime.\n- 8 is marked as \"not prime\", so we skip over it.\n- 9 is marked as \"not prime\", so we skip over it.\n- 10 is marked as \"not prime\", so we stop as there are no more numbers to check.\n\nYou've examined all numbers and found 2, 3, 5, and 7 are still unmarked, which means they're the primes less than or equal to 10.\n\nPlace the implementation in src/core/sieve.py",
