  "prompt": "# Instructions\n\nIf you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.\nFor this exercise, you need to know two things about them:\n\n- Each resistor has a resistance value.\n- Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.\n\nTo get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.\nEach band has a position and a numeric value.\n\nThe first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.\n\nIn this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.\n\nThese colors are encoded as follows:\n\n- black: 0\n- brown: 1\n- red: 2\n- orange: 3\n- yellow: 4\n- green: 5\n- blue: 6\n- violet: 7\n- grey: 8\n- white: 9\n\nThe goal of this exercise is to create a way:\n\n- to look up the numerical value associated with a particular color band\n- to list the different band colors\n\nMnemonics map the colors to the numbers, that, when stored as an array, happen to map to their index in the array:\nBetter Be Right Or Your Great Big Values Go Wrong.\n\nMore information on the color encoding of resistors can be found in the [Electronic color code Wikipedia article][e-color-code].\n\n[e-color-code]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code\n\nPlace the implementation in src/core/resistor_color.py",
