  "prompt": "# Introduction\n\nYou work for a bioengineering company that specializes in developing therapeutic solutions.\n\nYour team has just been given a new project to develop a targeted therapy for a rare type of cancer.\n\n~~~~exercism/note\nIt's all very complicated, but the basic idea is that sometimes people's bodies produce too much of a given protein.\nThat can cause all sorts of havoc.\n\nBut if you can create a very specific molecule (called a micro-RNA), it can prevent the protein from being produced.\n\nThis technique is called [RNA Interference][rnai].\n\n[rnai]: https://admin.acceleratingscience.com/ask-a-scientist/what-is-rnai/\n~~~~\n# Instructions\n\nYour task is determine the RNA complement of a given DNA sequence.\n\nBoth DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.\n\nThe four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).\n\nThe four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).\n\nGiven a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:\n\n- `G` -> `C`\n- `C` -> `G`\n- `T` -> `A`\n- `A` -> `U`\n\n~~~~exercism/note\nIf you want to look at how the inputs and outputs are structured, take a look at the examples in the test suite.\n~~~~\n\nPlace the implementation in src/core/rna_transcription.py",
