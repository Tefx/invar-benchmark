  "prompt": "# Introduction\n\nThe year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).\nThe first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).\nAs you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.\n\"Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?\nYou must be closer to 200 years old!\"\n\nAmused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.\nYou realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!\nAs Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.\nAfter some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.\nThe customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.\nYou make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.\n\n~~~~exercism/note\nIf you're wondering why Pluto didn't make the cut, go watch [this YouTube video][pluto-video].\n\n[pluto-video]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_2gbGXzFbs\n~~~~\n# Instructions\n\nGiven an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.\n\nOne Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.\nIf you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.\n\nFor the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:\n\n| Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |\n| ------- | ----------------------------- |\n| Mercury | 0.2408467                     |\n| Venus   | 0.61519726                    |\n| Earth   | 1.0                           |\n| Mars    | 1.8808158                     |\n| Jupiter | 11.862615                     |\n| Saturn  | 29.447498                     |\n| Uranus  | 84.016846                     |\n| Neptune | 164.79132                     |\n\n~~~~exercism/note\nThe actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).\nThe Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.\nWhile not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.\nSee [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.\n\n[year]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#Summary\n~~~~\n# Instructions append\n\nFor the Python track, this exercise asks you to create a `SpaceAge` _class_ (_[concept:python/classes]()_) that includes methods for all the planets of the solar system.\nMethods should follow the naming convention `on_<planet name>`.\n\nEach method should `return` the age (_\"on\" that planet_) in years, rounded to two decimal places:\n\n```python\n#creating an instance with one billion seconds, and calling .on_earth().\n>>> SpaceAge(1000000000).on_earth()\n\n#This is one billion seconds on Earth in years\n31.69\n```\n\nFor more information on constructing and using classes, see:\n\n-   [**A First Look at Classes**][first look at classes] from the Python documentation.\n-   [**A Word About names and Objects**][names and objects] from the Python documentation.\n-   [**Objects, values, and types**][objects, values and types] in the Python data model documentation.\n-   [**What is a Class?**][what is a class] from Trey Hunners Python Morsels website.\n\n[first look at classes]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-first-look-at-classes\n[names and objects]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-word-about-names-and-objects\n[objects, values and types]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types\n[what is a class]: https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-is-a-class/\n\nPlace the implementation in src/core/space_age.py",
