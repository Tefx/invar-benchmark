  "prompt": "# Introduction\n\nEvery month, your partner meets up with their best friend.\nBoth of them have very busy schedules, making it challenging to find a suitable date!\nGiven your own busy schedule, your partner always double-checks potential meetup dates with you:\n\n- \"Can I meet up on the first Friday of next month?\"\n- \"What about the third Wednesday?\"\n- \"Maybe the last Sunday?\"\n\nIn this month's call, your partner asked you this question:\n\n- \"I'd like to meet up on the teenth Thursday; is that okay?\"\n\nConfused, you ask what a \"teenth\" day is.\nYour partner explains that a teenth day, a concept they made up, refers to the days in a month that end in '-teenth':\n\n- 13th (thirteenth)\n- 14th (fourteenth)\n- 15th (fifteenth)\n- 16th (sixteenth)\n- 17th (seventeenth)\n- 18th (eighteenth)\n- 19th (nineteenth)\n\nAs there are also seven weekdays, it is guaranteed that each day of the week has _exactly one_ teenth day each month.\n\nNow that you understand the concept of a teenth day, you check your calendar.\nYou don't have anything planned on the teenth Thursday, so you happily confirm the date with your partner.\n# Instructions\n\nYour task is to find the exact date of a meetup, given a month, year, weekday and week.\n\nThere are five week values to consider: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.\n\nFor example, you might be asked to find the date for the meetup on the first Monday in January 2018 (January 1, 2018).\n\nSimilarly, you might be asked to find:\n\n- the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)\n- the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)\n- the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)\n- the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)\n- the teenth Saturday of August 1953 (August 15, 1953)\n\n## Teenth\n\nThe teenth week refers to the seven days in a month that end in '-teenth' (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th).\n\nIf asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953, we check its calendar:\n\n```plaintext\n    August 1953\nSu Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa\n                   1\n 2  3  4  5  6  7  8\n 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n16 17 18 19 20 21 22\n23 24 25 26 27 28 29\n30 31\n```\n\nFrom this we find that the teenth Saturday is August 15, 1953.\n# Instructions append\n\n## How this Exercise is Structured in Python\n\nWe have added an additional week descriptor (`fifth`) for the fifth weekday of the month, if there is one.  \nIf there is not a fifth weekday in a month, you should raise an exception.\n\n## Customizing and Raising Exceptions\n\nSometimes it is necessary to both [customize](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions) and [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions) exceptions in your code. When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.\n\nCustom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).\n\nFor situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception type, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/\"thrown\" when your `meetup()` function is given a weekday name and number combination that is invalid. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.\n\nTo customize a `built-in exception`, create a `class` that inherits from that exception. When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# subclassing the built-in ValueError to create MeetupDayException\nclass MeetupDayException(ValueError):\n    \"\"\"Exception raised when the Meetup weekday and count do not result in a valid date.\n\n    message: explanation of the error.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, message):\n        self.message = message\n\n        \n# raising a MeetupDayException\nraise MeetupDayException(\"That day does not exist.\")\n```\n\nPlace the implementation in src/core/meetup.py",
