  "prompt": "# Introduction\n\nYour friend Eliud inherited a farm from her grandma Tigist.\nHer granny was an inventor and had a tendency to build things in an overly complicated manner.\nThe chicken coop has a digital display showing an encoded number representing the positions of all eggs that could be picked up.\n\nEliud is asking you to write a program that shows the actual number of eggs in the coop.\n\nThe position information encoding is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Scan the potential egg-laying spots and mark down a `1` for an existing egg or a `0` for an empty spot.\n2. Convert the number from binary to decimal.\n3. Show the result on the display.\n\nExample 1:\n\n```text\nChicken Coop:\n _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n|E| |E|E| | |E|\n\nResulting Binary:\n 1 0 1 1 0 0 1\n\nDecimal number on the display:\n89\n\nActual eggs in the coop:\n4\n```\n\nExample 2:\n\n```text\nChicken Coop:\n _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n| | | |E| | | | |\n\nResulting Binary:\n 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nDecimal number on the display:\n16\n\nActual eggs in the coop:\n1\n```\n# Instructions\n\nYour task is to count the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of a number.\n\n## Restrictions\n\nKeep your hands off that bit-count functionality provided by your standard library!\nSolve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.\n\nPlace the implementation in src/core/eliuds_eggs.py",
