  "prompt": "# Introduction\n\nBob is a thief.\nAfter months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.\n\nIn front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.\nBob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.\nBob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.\n# Instructions\n\nYour task is to determine which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized, taking into account the knapsack's carrying capacity.\n\nItems will be represented as a list of items.\nEach item will have a weight and value.\nAll values given will be strictly positive.\nBob can take only one of each item.\n\nFor example:\n\n```text\nItems: [\n  { \"weight\": 5, \"value\": 10 },\n  { \"weight\": 4, \"value\": 40 },\n  { \"weight\": 6, \"value\": 30 },\n  { \"weight\": 4, \"value\": 50 }\n]\n\nKnapsack Maximum Weight: 10\n```\n\nFor the above, the first item has weight 5 and value 10, the second item has weight 4 and value 40, and so on.\nIn this example, Bob should take the second and fourth item to maximize his value, which, in this case, is 90.\nHe cannot get more than 90 as his knapsack has a weight limit of 10.\n\nPlace the implementation in src/core/knapsack.py",
