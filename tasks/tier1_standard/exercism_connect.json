O . X .\n . X X O .\n  O O O X .\n   . X O X O\n    X O O O X\n```\n\n\"Player `O`\" plays from top to bottom, \"Player `X`\" plays from left to right.\nIn the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.\n\n[hex]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29\n\nPlace the implementation in src/core/connect.py",
